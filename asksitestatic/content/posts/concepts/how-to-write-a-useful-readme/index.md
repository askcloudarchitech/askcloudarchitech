It's time for a little self-reflection. 

Take a little time to think back over **every single project you have ever created**. OK, now right at this moment, what are you thinking about? Are you thinking about the code? Are you remembering the language, the functions, the classes? Or, are you think about what the project did? **Are you thinking about the problem that it solved?** 

Well, if you are like most people in this world, you are thinking about the latter. After all the code is written and the tool you poured your heart and soul into is done, **the code itself doesn't really matter, does it?** So that begs the question: if the problem you solved is more important than how you solved it, why is it that the **one single file** in your project that actually focuses on the functionality is the one that's most commonly ignored? You know what file I'm talking about, right? **The README!** 

Let's be honest for a minute, **all of your READMEs are afterthoughts**. They are a chore that needs to be done. Well, today IS the day that you could **turn all of that around**. Today you could choose to give your READMEs all of the **respect that they deserve**! Come with me on a journey into your README dumpster fire. What it is now, what it could be, and what it could mean for you and your project when **done CORRECTLY.** 

## A brief history of bad READMEs

Before we dive into why you want a good README and how to make one, let's take a look at some of the most notoriously bad READMEs out there in the wastelands of forgotten projects. 

**The one-liner -** We all know this one because you essentially get this README for free just by checking the "create a README" box in Github when you create a repo. This is the one with **JUST the title** of the project and **NOTHING else.** If you have a one-liner README, at least you have one. I guess that's a win?

**The ghost -** If there is anything **worse than the one-liner**, it's the ghost. In this case, you couldn't even be bothered to check the box in Github to auto-generate your README. The **README literally doesn't exist.** If your project doesn't have a README, it's just a useless pile of code clogging up the interwebs. 

**The over-explainer -** Ah yes, the **exact opposite of the ghost** is the over-explainer. You know, the one where the README is so **long and complicated** that nobody would ever possibly take the time to read the whole thing? READMEs are made to be a summary, not all of your comments compiled into doc.

**The out-of-date -** This one is **all-to-common**. You **started with good intentions** and wrote a README worth actually reading, but then, slowly, everything started to fall apart. A refactor of a whole portion of the app wasn't documented. A brand new set of config was completely forgotten. The architecture diagram is completly out of whack. This README is quite possibly the worst because it can be **completely mileading**. The poor soul who tried to follow your **three year old instructions** hates you right now. 

**The broken promise -** I'll spare you the dramatics and simply leave you with this: "README coming soon!" *Facepalm.*

## Benefits of a well-written README

I hope the section above made you feel both **ashamed of yourself** for the complete dumpster fire you have spread across the internet as well as **motivated** to make it right! A well-written README has the potential to be **so much more than just another piece of documentation**. Let's take a moment to consider the **massive benefits** of a README written with purpose.

**SEO benefit -** When people search for solutions, they dont exactly go to the old googly box and start typing code examples. What do they do, they type out the functionality they are looking for. If you can write a  good README with a strong, **keyword rich explanation** of your project's functionality, there's a good chance **search engines will pick it up** and put it in front of you future users/contributors. 

**Gain users -** You want your super awesome project to be **popular**, right? Well, without a readme (or really any of those READMEs listed above) you won't exactly be pulling in your next biggest fans. As a matter of fact, you may actually be confusing them or scaring them away. **Write a solid README and the users will come!**

**Gain contributors -** You can't continue to make this totally awsome project of yours completly on your own (yeah I'm talking to you), **you need contributors!** And... if you want to gain contributors you need people who like what you made so much that **they want to help** make it better. READMEs serve **two purposes** here: 1 **attract** your future contributer and, 2 **explain** how to actually contribute (but more on that later)

**Remind yourself later -** I'm not the only one with this problem, right? You made something cool and you know generally that it exists, but forget some of the important details. If there is one reason to write a README it might be this. Write it for your forgetful future self. Seriously, you'll get old too. And you will forget stuff. 

**Reduce reported issues -** Steam is starting to coming out of my ears just thinking about this. You want to know the most aggrivating part of software development? When you know that your project has a bug or known issue and someone reports it to you like don't already know. Having someone explain to you in great detail that known issue you already wasted like 30 hours on is THE WORST. So... avoid that situation alltogether by simply adding a "known issues" section to your README. This will work like a charm (unless that annoying issue reporter also doesnt read).

**Make money? -** hey, why not?! You can totally make money from a README. More on that in the next section. 

## How to craft a useful, well-written README

**Learn Markdown -** Just In case you are a ghoster or a or a one-liner from above, I think its important to point out that README files are written in Markdown. Markdown is super easy to learn might even be worth committing to memory. Don't know markdown? [Here's a great doc](https://www.markdownguide.org/) on how it all works.

I think if you've made it this far through this post, you have just gotta be super PUMPED about getting into this README action! Now that you've seen the failures and you know all the benefits, are you ready to learn, exactly, how to structure a README masterpiece? Let's (finally) get into the details. Here's the list, in order, of elements you should have in your README.

1. **A strong H1 title and an H2 subtitle** - Just like writing an article or a blog post, you need a great title and subtitle to attract search engines and humans. It doesn't need to be the name of your project, but it does help if your title includes the name of the project. 
2. **An intro paragraph focused on what the project *does*** *\-* Write an intro paragraph about what this project is, what it does and how its used
3. **Another one or two paragraphs explaining the benefits of your project for the user -**
4. **Diagram (optional) -**  make a small diagram or animated gif showing it in action
5. **Installation and usage instructions (for end users)**
6. **Installation and usage instructions (for contributors)**
7. **Contributor expectations -** code quality expectations, automated testing etc
8. **Known issues**
9. **Begging for money!**

keep it up to date. - its just part of the workflow.

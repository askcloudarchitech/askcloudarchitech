It's time for a little self-reflection. 

Take a little time to think back over **every single project you have ever created**. OK, now right at this moment, what are you thinking about? Are you thinking about the code? Are you remembering the language, the functions, the classes? Or, are you think about what the project did? **Are you thinking about the problem that it solved?** 

Well, if you are like most people in this world, you are thinking about the latter. After all the code is written and the tool you poured your heart and soul into is done, **the code itself doesn't really matter, does it?** So that begs the question: if the problem you solved is more important than how you solved it, why is it that the **one single file** in your project that actually focuses on the functionality is the one that's most commonly ignored? You know what file I'm talking about, right? **The README!** 

Let's be honest for a minute, **all of your READMEs are afterthoughts**. They are a chore that needs to be done. Well, today IS the day that you could **turn all of that around**. Today you could choose to give your READMEs all of the **respect that they deserve**! Come with me on a journey into your README dumpster fire. What it is now, what it could be, and what it could mean for you and your project when **done CORRECTLY.** 

## A brief history of bad READMEs

Before we dive into why you want a good README and how to make one, let's take a look at some of the most notoriously bad READMEs out there in the wastelands of forgotten projects. 

**The one-liner -** We all know this one because you essentially get this README for free just by checking the "create a README" box in Github when you create a repo. This is the one with **JUST the title** of the project and **NOTHING else.** If you have a one-liner README, at least you have one. I guess that's a win?

**The ghost -** If there is anything **worse than the one-liner**, it's the ghost. In this case, you couldn't even be bothered to check the box in Github to auto-generate your README. The **README literally doesn't exist.** If your project doesn't have a README, it's just a useless pile of code clogging up the interwebs. 

**The over-explainer -** 

**The out-of-date -** 

**The broken promise -** 

## Benefits of a well-written README

I hope the section above made you feel both **ashamed of yourself** for the complete dumpster fire you have spread across the internet as well as **motivated** to make it right! A well-written README has the potential to be **so much more than just another piece of documentation**. Let's take a moment to consider the **massive benefits** of a README written with purpose.

## How to craft a useful, well-written README

learn markdown - its your friend

start with a strong h1 title and an h2 subtitle giving a short summary of the purpose of the project

write an intro paragraph about what this project is, what it does and how its used

Explain how to install your project as a consumer - step by step

Explain how to contribute to the project - instructions to a developer on how to use and install. more technical 

If necessary, make a small diagram or animated gif showing it in action

set expectations for contributors - code quality expectations, automated testing etc

Document known issues 

Ask for a contribution!

keep it up to date. - its just part of the workflow.

## This is just the beginning...

If you've come here looking for answers to your burning systems architecture questions, unfortunately it's not quite time yet. Ask Cloud Architech is just getting started and I am looking for some brave souls who would like to ask some architecture questions. I'm looking forward to answering some questions soon!

## What types of architecture questions can I ask?

I have been designing systems related to digital marketing and web sites for my entire career. If you have questions about anything related to how websites are built (large or small), fire away. Some of my areas of expertise include:

- Google Cloud Platform
- Kubernetes
- Microservices architecture
- Docker
- CI/CD systems
- Automated testing
